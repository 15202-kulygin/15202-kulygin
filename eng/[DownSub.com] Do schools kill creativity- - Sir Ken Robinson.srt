1
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,678
Good morning. How are you?

2
00:00:29,702 --> 00:00:30,912
(Laughter)

3
00:00:30,936 --> 00:00:33,249
It's been great, hasn't it?

4
00:00:33,273 --> 00:00:35,729
I've been blown away by the whole thing.

5
00:00:35,753 --> 00:00:37,245
In fact, I'm leaving.

6
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:42,836
(Laughter)

7
00:00:43,15 --> 00:00:46,222
There have been three themes
running through the conference

8
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,753
which are relevant
to what I want to talk about.

9
00:00:48,777 --> 00:00:53,467
One is the extraordinary
evidence of human creativity

10
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:55,904
in all of the presentations that we've had

11
00:00:55,928 --> 00:00:57,729
and in all of the people here.

12
00:00:57,753 --> 00:01:00,404
Just the variety of it
and the range of it.

13
00:01:01,158 --> 00:01:03,301
The second is
that it's put us in a place

14
00:01:03,325 --> 00:01:05,822
where we have no idea
what's going to happen,

15
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:07,237
in terms of the future.

16
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:09,976
No idea how this may play out.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,892
I have an interest in education.

18
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:16,48
Actually, what I find is everybody
has an interest in education.

19
00:01:16,72 --> 00:01:17,210
Don't you?

20
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:18,714
I find this very interesting.

21
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:20,496
If you're at a dinner party,

22
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:22,858
and you say you work in education --

23
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:25,846
Actually, you're not often
at dinner parties, frankly.

24
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,666
(Laughter)

25
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,118
If you work in education,
you're not asked.

26
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:35,232
(Laughter)

27
00:01:35,257 --> 00:01:38,976
And you're never asked back, curiously.
That's strange to me.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,475
But if you are, and you say to somebody,

29
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:43,276
you know, they say, "What do you do?"

30
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,976
and you say you work in education,

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,76
you can see the blood run from their face.

32
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,380
They're like, "Oh my God,"
you know, "Why me?"

33
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:51,41
(Laughter)

34
00:01:51,65 --> 00:01:52,688
"My one night out all week."

35
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,322
(Laughter)

36
00:01:55,346 --> 00:01:58,587
But if you ask about their education,
they pin you to the wall.

37
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:02,78
Because it's one of those things
that goes deep with people, am I right?

38
00:02:02,194 --> 00:02:05,535
Like religion, and money and other things.

39
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:09,911
So I have a big interest in education,
and I think we all do.

40
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:11,827
We have a huge vested interest in it,

41
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:15,171
partly because it's education
that's meant to take us into this future

42
00:02:15,195 --> 00:02:16,714
that we can't grasp.

43
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:20,372
If you think of it,
children starting school this year

44
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:23,920
will be retiring in 2065.

45
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:26,843
Nobody has a clue,

46
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:30,310
despite all the expertise that's been
on parade for the past four days,

47
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,976
what the world will look like
in five years' time.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,294
And yet we're meant
to be educating them for it.

49
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:37,868
So the unpredictability,
I think, is extraordinary.

50
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,259
And the third part of this

51
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:41,320
is that we've all agreed, nonetheless,

52
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:46,649
on the really extraordinary
capacities that children have --

53
00:02:46,673 --> 00:02:49,7
their capacities for innovation.

54
00:02:49,31 --> 00:02:51,542
I mean, Sirena last night
was a marvel, wasn't she?

55
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:53,176
Just seeing what she could do.

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,976
And she's exceptional, but I think
she's not, so to speak,

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,956
exceptional in the whole of childhood.

58
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,775
What you have there is a person
of extraordinary dedication

59
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,67
who found a talent.

60
00:03:06,91 --> 00:03:08,700
And my contention is,
all kids have tremendous talents.

61
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,776
And we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.

62
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,976
So I want to talk about education

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,872
and I want to talk about creativity.

64
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:20,915
My contention is that creativity now
is as important in education as literacy,

65
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:23,803
and we should treat it
with the same status.

66
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:25,798
(Applause) Thank you.

67
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:30,167
(Applause)

68
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:31,744
That was it, by the way.

69
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:32,771
Thank you very much.

70
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,910
(Laughter)

71
00:03:34,934 --> 00:03:36,611
So, 15 minutes left.

72
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:39,571
(Laughter)

73
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,487
Well, I was born... no.

74
00:03:41,511 --> 00:03:44,543
(Laughter)

75
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:47,312
I heard a great story recently
-- I love telling it --

76
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:50,51
of a little girl
who was in a drawing lesson.

77
00:03:50,75 --> 00:03:52,209
She was six, and she was
at the back, drawing,

78
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:55,34
and the teacher said this girl
hardly ever paid attention,

79
00:03:55,58 --> 00:03:56,844
and in this drawing lesson, she did.

80
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:58,208
The teacher was fascinated.

81
00:03:58,232 --> 00:04:00,994
She went over to her,
and she said, "What are you drawing?"

82
00:04:01,18 --> 00:04:03,509
And the girl said, "I'm
drawing a picture of God."

83
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:07,960
And the teacher said, "But nobody
knows what God looks like."

84
00:04:07,984 --> 00:04:10,72
And the girl said,
"They will, in a minute."

85
00:04:10,96 --> 00:04:16,878
(Laughter)

86
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,929
When my son was four in England --

87
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:26,604
Actually, he was four
everywhere, to be honest.

88
00:04:26,628 --> 00:04:28,294
(Laughter)

89
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:31,791
If we're being strict about it,
wherever he went, he was four that year.

90
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:34,453
He was in the Nativity play.
Do you remember the story?

91
00:04:34,477 --> 00:04:35,695
(Laughter)

92
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,547
No, it was big, it was a big story.

93
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:39,876
Mel Gibson did the sequel,
you may have seen it.

94
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,161
(Laughter)

95
00:04:41,185 --> 00:04:42,495
"Nativity II."

96
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:46,654
But James got the part of Joseph,
which we were thrilled about.

97
00:04:46,678 --> 00:04:49,215
We considered this to be
one of the lead parts.

98
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:51,715
We had the place crammed
full of agents in T-shirts:

99
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,976
"James Robinson IS Joseph!" (Laughter)

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,607
He didn't have to speak,

101
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:58,68
but you know the bit
where the three kings come in?

102
00:04:58,93 --> 00:05:00,824
They come in bearing gifts,
gold, frankincense and myrrh.

103
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:01,962
This really happened.

104
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:05,75
We were sitting there and I think
they just went out of sequence,

105
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,876
because we talked to the little boy
afterward and we said,

106
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,775
"You OK with that?" And he said,
"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?"

107
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,876
They just switched.

108
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,75
The three boys came in,

109
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,287
four-year-olds with tea towels
on their heads,

110
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:16,801
and they put these boxes down,

111
00:05:16,826 --> 00:05:18,875
and the first boy said,
"I bring you gold."

112
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:21,37
And the second boy said,
"I bring you myrrh."

113
00:05:21,61 --> 00:05:23,65
And the third boy said, "Frank sent this."

114
00:05:23,89 --> 00:05:25,989
(Laughter)

115
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:38,801
What these things have in common
is that kids will take a chance.

116
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:41,433
If they don't know, they'll have a go.

117
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:44,994
Am I right? They're not
frightened of being wrong.

118
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:49,400
I don't mean to say that being wrong
is the same thing as being creative.

119
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:52,976
What we do know is,
if you're not prepared to be wrong,

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,367
you'll never come up
with anything original --

121
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:57,476
if you're not prepared to be wrong.

122
00:05:57,877 --> 00:06:02,10
And by the time they get to be adults,
most kids have lost that capacity.

123
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:04,926
They have become
frightened of being wrong.

124
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,640
And we run our companies like this.

125
00:06:06,664 --> 00:06:08,316
We stigmatize mistakes.

126
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,642
And we're now running
national education systems

127
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,12
where mistakes are the worst
thing you can make.

128
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,908
And the result is that
we are educating people

129
00:06:16,932 --> 00:06:19,223
out of their creative capacities.

130
00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:23,725
Picasso once said this, he said
that all children are born artists.

131
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:26,971
The problem is to remain an artist
as we grow up.

132
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:30,76
I believe this passionately,
that we don't grow into creativity,

133
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,956
we grow out of it.

134
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,863
Or rather, we get educated out of it.

135
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:35,720
So why is this?

136
00:06:35,826 --> 00:06:39,907
I lived in Stratford-on-Avon
until about five years ago.

137
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:42,183
In fact, we moved
from Stratford to Los Angeles.

138
00:06:42,872 --> 00:06:45,536
So you can imagine
what a seamless transition that was.

139
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,976
(Laughter)

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,376
Actually, we lived in a place
called Snitterfield,

141
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,650
just outside Stratford,

142
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,836
which is where
Shakespeare's father was born.

143
00:06:53,82 --> 00:06:55,457
Are you struck by a new thought? I was.

144
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,76
You don't think of Shakespeare
having a father, do you?

145
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,976
Do you? Because you don't think
of Shakespeare being a child, do you?

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,567
Shakespeare being seven?

147
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:04,840
I never thought of it.

148
00:07:04,864 --> 00:07:06,548
I mean, he was seven at some point.

149
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:08,882
He was in somebody's
English class, wasn't he?

150
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:15,693
(Laughter)

151
00:07:15,717 --> 00:07:17,46
How annoying would that be?

152
00:07:17,70 --> 00:07:20,70
(Laughter)

153
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:25,764
"Must try harder."

154
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:29,688
(Laughter)

155
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:33,176
Being sent to bed by his dad, you know,
to Shakespeare, "Go to bed, now!

156
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,628
And put the pencil down."

157
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:36,726
(Laughter)

158
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,305
"And stop speaking like that."

159
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:42,220
(Laughter)

160
00:07:42,244 --> 00:07:43,568
"It's confusing everybody."

161
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:48,715
(Laughter)

162
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:54,77
Anyway, we moved
from Stratford to Los Angeles,

163
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:56,542
and I just want to say a word
about the transition.

164
00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:57,976
My son didn't want to come.

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,976
I've got two kids;
he's 21 now, my daughter's 16.

166
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,44
He didn't want to come to Los Angeles.

167
00:08:03,68 --> 00:08:06,24
He loved it, but he had
a girlfriend in England.

168
00:08:06,48 --> 00:08:09,651
This was the love of his life, Sarah.

169
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:11,136
He'd known her for a month.

170
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,510
(Laughter)

171
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,789
Mind you, they'd had
their fourth anniversary,

172
00:08:14,814 --> 00:08:17,753
because it's a long time when you're 16.

173
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:19,438
He was really upset on the plane,

174
00:08:19,462 --> 00:08:21,923
he said, "I'll never find
another girl like Sarah."

175
00:08:21,947 --> 00:08:24,325
And we were rather pleased
about that, frankly --

176
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:27,248
(Laughter)

177
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:35,275
Because she was the main reason
we were leaving the country.

178
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:38,299
(Laughter)

179
00:08:41,58 --> 00:08:43,400
But something strikes you
when you move to America

180
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:44,790
and travel around the world:

181
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:48,193
Every education system on Earth
has the same hierarchy of subjects.

182
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:50,492
Every one. Doesn't matter where you go.

183
00:08:50,516 --> 00:08:52,786
You'd think it would be
otherwise, but it isn't.

184
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,776
At the top are mathematics and languages,

185
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,233
then the humanities,
and at the bottom are the arts.

186
00:08:57,258 --> 00:08:58,376
Everywhere on Earth.

187
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,495
And in pretty much every system too,
there's a hierarchy within the arts.

188
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,376
Art and music are normally
given a higher status in schools

189
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,567
than drama and dance.

190
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:08,847
There isn't an education
system on the planet

191
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:10,929
that teaches dance everyday to children

192
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:13,000
the way we teach them mathematics. Why?

193
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:16,225
Why not? I think this is rather important.

194
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:18,552
I think math is very
important, but so is dance.

195
00:09:18,576 --> 00:09:21,476
Children dance all the time
if they're allowed to, we all do.

196
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,976
We all have bodies, don't we?
Did I miss a meeting?

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,338
(Laughter)

198
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,845
Truthfully, what happens is,
as children grow up,

199
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,637
we start to educate them progressively
from the waist up.

200
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:34,286
And then we focus on their heads.

201
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,800
And slightly to one side.

202
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:38,976
If you were to visit
education, as an alien,

203
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,976
and say "What's it for, public education?"

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,776
I think you'd have to conclude,
if you look at the output,

205
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,175
who really succeeds by this,

206
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,976
who does everything that they should,

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,731
who gets all the brownie
points, who are the winners --

208
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:54,94
I think you'd have to conclude
the whole purpose of public education

209
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:55,215
throughout the world

210
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:57,192
is to produce university professors.

211
00:09:57,216 --> 00:09:58,527
Isn't it?

212
00:09:58,551 --> 00:10:00,534
They're the people who come out the top.

213
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,737
And I used to be one, so there.

214
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:05,396
(Laughter)

215
00:10:05,421 --> 00:10:08,522
And I like university
professors, but you know,

216
00:10:08,546 --> 00:10:10,21
we shouldn't hold them up

217
00:10:10,45 --> 00:10:12,976
as the high-water mark
of all human achievement.

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,976
They're just a form of life,

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,560
another form of life.

220
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:19,882
But they're rather curious, and I say this
out of affection for them.

221
00:10:19,906 --> 00:10:22,876
There's something curious
about professors in my experience --

222
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,576
not all of them, but typically,
they live in their heads.

223
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,743
They live up there,
and slightly to one side.

224
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:31,869
They're disembodied, you know,
in a kind of literal way.

225
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:34,986
They look upon their body as a form
of transport for their heads.

226
00:10:35,10 --> 00:10:41,176
(Laughter)

227
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,216
Don't they?

228
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,462
It's a way of getting
their head to meetings.

229
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:49,997
(Laughter)

230
00:10:50,22 --> 00:10:53,852
If you want real evidence
of out-of-body experiences,

231
00:10:53,876 --> 00:10:57,362
get yourself along to a residential
conference of senior academics,

232
00:10:57,386 --> 00:10:59,629
and pop into the discotheque
on the final night.

233
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:02,454
(Laughter)

234
00:11:02,478 --> 00:11:03,834
And there, you will see it.

235
00:11:03,858 --> 00:11:07,976
Grown men and women
writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.

236
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,867
(Laughter)

237
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:14,216
Waiting until it ends so they can
go home and write a paper about it.

238
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,144
(Laughter)

239
00:11:16,168 --> 00:11:20,11
Our education system is predicated
on the idea of academic ability.

240
00:11:20,35 --> 00:11:21,276
And there's a reason.

241
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,856
Around the world, there were
no public systems of education,

242
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,986
really, before the 19th century.

243
00:11:27,10 --> 00:11:29,967
They all came into being
to meet the needs of industrialism.

244
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:32,432
So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.

245
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:37,53
Number one, that the most useful
subjects for work are at the top.

246
00:11:37,77 --> 00:11:39,108
So you were
probably steered benignly away

247
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:42,65
from things at school when you
were a kid, things you liked,

248
00:11:42,90 --> 00:11:45,476
on the grounds that you would
never get a job doing that. Is that right?

249
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,881
Don't do music, you're not
going to be a musician;

250
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:49,706
don't do art, you won't be an artist.

251
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,150
Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken.

252
00:11:53,174 --> 00:11:55,319
The whole world
is engulfed in a revolution.

253
00:11:55,343 --> 00:11:57,439
And the second is academic ability,

254
00:11:57,464 --> 00:12:00,349
which has really come to dominate
our view of intelligence,

255
00:12:00,373 --> 00:12:03,276
because the universities designed
the system in their image.

256
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,794
If you think of it, the whole system
of public education around the world

257
00:12:06,818 --> 00:12:09,44
is a protracted process
of university entrance.

258
00:12:09,68 --> 00:12:11,401
And the consequence
is that many highly-talented,

259
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:13,859
brilliant, creative
people think they're not,

260
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:16,22
because the thing
they were good at at school

261
00:12:16,46 --> 00:12:18,154
wasn't valued,
or was actually stigmatized.

262
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:20,679
And I think we can't afford
to go on that way.

263
00:12:20,703 --> 00:12:23,167
In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO,

264
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:26,1
more people worldwide will be graduating

265
00:12:26,25 --> 00:12:28,571
through education
than since the beginning of history.

266
00:12:28,595 --> 00:12:32,276
More people, and it's the combination
of all the things we've talked about --

267
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,348
technology and its transformation
effect on work, and demography

268
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:37,175
and the huge explosion in population.

269
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,65
Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything.

270
00:12:40,89 --> 00:12:41,469
Isn't that true?

271
00:12:41,723 --> 00:12:44,476
When I was a student,
if you had a degree, you had a job.

272
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,276
If you didn't have a job,
it's because you didn't want one.

273
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,976
And I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter)

274
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,74
But now kids with degrees

275
00:12:54,98 --> 00:12:57,142
are often heading home
to carry on playing video games,

276
00:12:57,167 --> 00:13:00,365
because you need an MA where
the previous job required a BA,

277
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:02,176
and now you need a PhD for the other.

278
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,976
It's a process of academic inflation.

279
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,376
And it indicates the whole
structure of education

280
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,833
is shifting beneath our feet.

281
00:13:07,857 --> 00:13:10,477
We need to radically rethink
our view of intelligence.

282
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:12,496
We know three things about intelligence.

283
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,747
One, it's diverse.

284
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:16,776
We think about the world in all the ways
that we experience it.

285
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,776
We think visually, we think in sound,
we think kinesthetically.

286
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,101
We think in abstract terms,
we think in movement.

287
00:13:22,246 --> 00:13:24,000
Secondly, intelligence is dynamic.

288
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:26,976
If you look at the interactions
of a human brain,

289
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,976
as we heard yesterday
from a number of presentations,

290
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,976
intelligence is wonderfully interactive.

291
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,238
The brain isn't divided into compartments.

292
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:37,976
In fact, creativity --
which I define as the process

293
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,325
of having original ideas
that have value --

294
00:13:40,349 --> 00:13:43,1
more often than not comes about
through the interaction

295
00:13:43,25 --> 00:13:46,25
of different disciplinary
ways of seeing things.

296
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,976
By the way, there's a shaft of nerves
that joins the two halves of the brain

297
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,491
called the corpus callosum.

298
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:53,781
It's thicker in women.

299
00:13:54,88 --> 00:13:55,829
Following off from Helen yesterday,

300
00:13:55,853 --> 00:13:58,976
this is probably why women
are better at multi-tasking.

301
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,817
Because you are, aren't you?

302
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:04,48
There's a raft of research,
but I know it from my personal life.

303
00:14:04,738 --> 00:14:09,976
If my wife is cooking a meal at home --
which is not often, thankfully.

304
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,854
(Laughter)

305
00:14:12,878 --> 00:14:15,376
No, she's good at some things,
but if she's cooking,

306
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,276
she's dealing with people on the phone,

307
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,856
she's talking to the kids,
she's painting the ceiling,

308
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,976
she's doing open-heart surgery over here.

309
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,976
If I'm cooking, the door
is shut, the kids are out,

310
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,976
the phone's on the hook,
if she comes in I get annoyed.

311
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,71
I say, "Terry, please,
I'm trying to fry an egg in here."

312
00:14:32,95 --> 00:14:38,825
(Laughter)

313
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:40,454
"Give me a break."

314
00:14:40,478 --> 00:14:42,198
(Laughter)

315
00:14:42,222 --> 00:14:44,721
Actually, do you know
that old philosophical thing,

316
00:14:44,745 --> 00:14:47,998
if a tree falls in a forest
and nobody hears it, did it happen?

317
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:49,580
Remember that old chestnut?

318
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:52,14
I saw a great t-shirt
recently, which said,

319
00:14:52,38 --> 00:14:55,976
"If a man speaks his mind
in a forest, and no woman hears him,

320
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,396
is he still wrong?"

321
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:03,26
(Laughter)

322
00:15:04,976 --> 00:15:06,976
And the third thing about intelligence is,

323
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,369
it's distinct.

324
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:11,327
I'm doing a new book at the moment
called "Epiphany,"

325
00:15:11,351 --> 00:15:13,825
which is based on a series
of interviews with people

326
00:15:13,849 --> 00:15:15,769
about how they discovered their talent.

327
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:17,962
I'm fascinated
by how people got to be there.

328
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:21,176
It's really prompted by a conversation
I had with a wonderful woman

329
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,876
who maybe most people
have never heard of, Gillian Lynne.

330
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,530
Have you heard of her? Some have.

331
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:28,76
She's a choreographer,
and everybody knows her work.

332
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,101
She did "Cats" and "Phantom of the Opera."

333
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,103
She's wonderful.

334
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:33,272
I used to be on the board
of The Royal Ballet,

335
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:34,498
as you can see.

336
00:15:34,522 --> 00:15:36,922
Anyway, Gillian and I had
lunch one day and I said,

337
00:15:37,47 --> 00:15:38,847
"How did you get to be a dancer?"

338
00:15:38,976 --> 00:15:39,976
It was interesting.

339
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,350
When she was at school,
she was really hopeless.

340
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,976
And the school, in the '30s,
wrote to her parents and said,

341
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
"We think Gillian
has a learning disorder."

342
00:15:48,24 --> 00:15:50,166
She couldn't concentrate;
she was fidgeting.

343
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,480
I think now they'd say she had ADHD.
Wouldn't you?

344
00:15:53,504 --> 00:15:57,563
But this was the 1930s, and ADHD
hadn't been invented at this point.

345
00:15:57,587 --> 00:15:59,976
It wasn't an available condition.

346
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,737
(Laughter)

347
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,820
People weren't aware they could have that.

348
00:16:04,845 --> 00:16:06,979
(Laughter)

349
00:16:07,3 --> 00:16:11,281
Anyway, she went to see this specialist.

350
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:15,26
So, this oak-paneled room,
and she was there with her mother,

351
00:16:15,51 --> 00:16:17,528
and she was led and sat
on this chair at the end,

352
00:16:17,552 --> 00:16:21,191
and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes
while this man talked to her mother

353
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:23,543
about the problems
Gillian was having at school.

354
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:27,244
Because she was disturbing people;
her homework was always late; and so on,

355
00:16:27,268 --> 00:16:28,364
little kid of eight.

356
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:31,443
In the end, the doctor
went and sat next to Gillian, and said,

357
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:34,172
"I've listened to all these
things your mother's told me,

358
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:35,815
I need to speak to her privately.

359
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,215
Wait here. We'll be back;
we won't be very long,"

360
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:40,564
and they went and left her.

361
00:16:40,588 --> 00:16:42,223
But as they went out of the room,

362
00:16:42,248 --> 00:16:44,748
he turned on the radio
that was sitting on his desk.

363
00:16:45,342 --> 00:16:48,771
And when they got out, he said to her
mother, "Just stand and watch her."

364
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,991
And the minute they left the room,

365
00:16:52,15 --> 00:16:54,499
she was on her feet, moving to the music.

366
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:57,976
And they watched for a few minutes
and he turned to her mother and said,

367
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,976
"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian
isn't sick; she's a dancer.

368
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,976
Take her to a dance school."

369
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,976
I said, "What happened?"

370
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,976
She said, "She did. I can't tell you
how wonderful it was.

371
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,752
We walked in this room
and it was full of people like me.

372
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:13,976
People who couldn't sit still.

373
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,587
People who had to move to think."
Who had to move to think.

374
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,376
They did ballet, they did tap, jazz;
they did modern; they did contemporary.

375
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,220
She was eventually auditioned
for the Royal Ballet School;

376
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:28,542
she became a soloist; she had
a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet.

377
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:31,175
She eventually graduated
from the Royal Ballet School,

378
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,175
founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company,

379
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,443
met Andrew Lloyd Webber.

380
00:17:34,568 --> 00:17:35,977
She's been responsible for

381
00:17:36,1 --> 00:17:39,147
some of the most successful
musical theater productions in history,

382
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:42,244
she's given pleasure to millions,
and she's a multi-millionaire.

383
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:46,339
Somebody else might have put her
on medication and told her to calm down.

384
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:53,146
(Applause)

385
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:55,176
What I think it comes to is this:

386
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,976
Al Gore spoke the other night

387
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,269
about ecology and the revolution
that was triggered by Rachel Carson.

388
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,277
I believe our only hope for the future

389
00:18:04,301 --> 00:18:08,134
is to adopt a new conception
of human ecology,

390
00:18:08,158 --> 00:18:10,976
one in which we start
to reconstitute our conception

391
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,976
of the richness of human capacity.

392
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,499
Our education system has mined our minds

393
00:18:16,523 --> 00:18:19,799
in the way that we strip-mine the earth:
for a particular commodity.

394
00:18:20,188 --> 00:18:22,672
And for the future, it won't serve us.

395
00:18:22,696 --> 00:18:24,976
We have to rethink
the fundamental principles

396
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,968
on which we're educating our children.

397
00:18:27,87 --> 00:18:29,761
There was a wonderful quote
by Jonas Salk, who said,

398
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:34,824
"If all the insects
were to disappear from the Earth,

399
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,688
within 50 years all life
on Earth would end.

400
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:41,760
If all human beings
disappeared from the Earth,

401
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:44,418
within 50 years all forms
of life would flourish."

402
00:18:45,244 --> 00:18:46,529
And he's right.

403
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,925
What TED celebrates is the gift
of the human imagination.

404
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:53,487
We have to be careful now

405
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:55,767
that we use this gift wisely

406
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:59,20
and that we avert some of the scenarios
that we've talked about.

407
00:18:59,44 --> 00:19:02,976
And the only way we'll do it is by seeing
our creative capacities

408
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,610
for the richness they are

409
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:07,816
and seeing our children
for the hope that they are.

410
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,237
And our task is to educate
their whole being,

411
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:11,745
so they can face this future.

412
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,976
By the way -- we may not see this future,

413
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,430
but they will.

414
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,533
And our job is to help them
make something of it.

415
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,557
Thank you very much.

416
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:22,581
(Applause)
